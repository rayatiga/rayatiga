        <h1>Privacy & Policy</h1>
        <p>We may require customer information, such as the name, username, email, address, and cellphone number, for registrar data needs. However, please note that the data made available to the public will be protected by WHOIS privacy, ensuring the security of the information you provide to us.</p>
        <p>Product and price information will be provided during discussions via WhatsApp. The products purchased are not covered by a warranty, meaning that once a transaction is completed, refunds cannot be issued. All the aforementioned services include 24/7 maintenance.</p>
        <p>In the event of any issues, updates, or similar changes, they will fall under the maintenance category. Requests will be processed based on the ticket queue but will still be addressed as promptly as possible. Typically, the resolution time ranges from zero to one day.</p>
        <p>If the purchased product is unsuitable or incorrect, a refund of 75% of the paid amount can be issued within a maximum of seven hours. If there is any lack of clarity or ambiguity, feel free to ask questions via our contact email, so that we can continuously improve this policy.</p>
